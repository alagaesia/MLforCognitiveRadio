# MLforCognitiveRadio

This repository contains the MATLAB code written for the final year project titled 'Machine Learning for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio'. The test dataset used for the folders "GradientDescent-KNN-2bits", "GradientDescent-SVM-2bits", "NelderMead-KNN-2bits" and "NelderMead-SVM-2bits" can be found at https://www.dropbox.com/s/dixnei1moppytzf/data_testSize1000000.mat?dl=0.

This dataset could not be uploaded on Github itself because of the 25 MB file size limit. So, before the MATLAB code in the above mentioned folders is run, the test dataset needs to be downloaded from Dropbox and included in the folders.

Instead of using this dataset, another test dataset with the same cognitive radio network parameters could be generated by calling the dataGeneration MATLAB function, present in each of the folders.
